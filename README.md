**Henu** is a powerful, customizable menu system that can be attached to any three-dimensional input device. It features various buttons, sliders, checkboxes, radio sets, and nested levels.

This project includes a complete demo application that shows several examples of how to configure and use **Henu**. The demo places you in the center of a collection of cubes, where you can use the menu to control the colors, animation, lighting, and camera.

**[Watch the Henu Demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI2oU7NgZEk)**. _Note: this is a 3D-enabled YouTube video. If you see red/blue 3D coloring, please switch to "Side-By-Side" mode in the video's 3D options section._
