**Hovercast** is a customizable menu interface for virtual reality applications. It provides menu navigation, buttons, sliders, and toggles – all using simple, reliable gestures.

Key features:

-	Hierarchical menu navigation
-	Several button, selector, and slider options
-	Proximity-based item selection
-	Arc-shaped menu bar extending from a central point
-	“Displacement menu” behavior: navigating to a parent/child level shifts the previous level out of the active menu bar
-	Complete customization options, via basic settings or custom item renderers
-	Ability to support a variety of 3D input devices.

This project includes a complete [demo application](tree/master/Unity/Assets/Hover/Demo/CastCubes) that provides several examples of **Hovercast** configuration and usage. The demo surrounds you with hundreds of cubes. Use the menu to control the scene's colors, animation, lighting, and camera. You can also review the [integration documents](../wiki) page to learn how to integrate Hovercast into a Unity project.

Want to try the demo for yourself?

**[Download the `2015-02-04` build >](http://www.aestheticinteractive.com/clients/hovercast/HovercastDemo-2015-02-04.zip)**

This package includes a full "LeapVR" demo and two "LeapOnly" demos (for both PC and Mac). All demos require a [Leap Motion controller](https://www.leapmotion.com/product/vr), and the VR demo requires an [Oculus Rift headset](https://www.oculus.com/). 

The "LeapOnly" demos are experimental. For reasons related to usability and Leap tracking, these may not work as well as the "LeapVR" demo. The "LeapOnly-HeadMount" demo provides a closer feel to the "LeapVR" demo, but requires the Leap Motion controller to be attached near to your eyes (try mounting it via hat or headband).
