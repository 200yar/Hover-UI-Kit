### Downloadable Demos

- [Hovercast Demo](http://www.aestheticinteractive.com/clients/hovercast/HovercastDemo-2015-02-04.zip) (`2015-02-04` build)
- [Hoverboard Demo](http://www.aestheticinteractive.com/clients/hoverboard/HoverboardDemo-2015-03-13.zip) (`2015-03-13` build)

The demo packages include a full "LeapVR" demo and two "LeapOnly" demos (for both PC and Mac). All demos require a [Leap Motion controller](https://www.leapmotion.com/product/vr), and the VR demo requires an [Oculus Rift headset](https://www.oculus.com/). 

The "LeapOnly" demos are experimental. For reasons related to usability and Leap tracking, these may not work as well as the "LeapVR" demo. The "LeapOnly-HeadMount" demo provides a closer feel to the "LeapVR" demo, but requires the Leap Motion controller to be attached near to your eyes (try mounting it via hat or headband).
