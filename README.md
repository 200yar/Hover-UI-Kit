**Hovercast** is a powerful, customizable menu system that can be attached to any three-dimensional input device. It features various buttons, sliders, checkboxes, radio sets, and nested levels.

This project includes a complete [demo application](https://github.com/aestheticinteractive/Hovercast/tree/master/Unity/Assets/HovercastDemo/Scripts) that provides several examples of **Hovercast** configuration and usage. The demo surrounds you with hundreds of cubes. Use the menu to control the scene's colors, animation, lighting, and camera.
